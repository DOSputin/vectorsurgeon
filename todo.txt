DONE

don't send parameter changes twice when setting meta values -- can just send from the update listeners!
button control type which maps to a chunk of code
controlwindow.sendmidimessages() should take note of midi channel!
refactor Machine calls into ControlWindow, making PatchWindow the same

PENDING

TODO

actions should "dirty" the window
name to component map should be a list, as there can be duplicate components in patch window!
more meta parameters - envelope stages, etc
write joystick test app to check we have it right
