button control type which maps to a chunk of code
controlwindow.sendmidimessages() should take note of midi channel!
refactor Machine calls into ControlWindow, making PatchWindow the same
make generic + mac source bases
actions should "dirty" the window
name to component map is now a list
generic actions based on a list of key value parameter pairs
