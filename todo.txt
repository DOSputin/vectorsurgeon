DONE

don't send parameter changes twice when setting meta values -- can just send from the update listeners!
button control type which maps to a chunk of code
controlwindow.sendmidimessages() should take note of midi channel!
refactor Machine calls into ControlWindow, making PatchWindow the same
make generic + mac source bases
actions should "dirty" the window
name to component map is now a list
generic actions based on a list of key value parameter pairs
monosynth mode -- set all oscs, detune, filter & amp settings
envelope controls are dirtying patches unnecessarily
update duplicate controls on parameter change
reset pan to zero action/meta
set params from midi only selects the first tab
re-centre vary window when things are selected
should be able to vary the patch being edited
split simple synth into proper panes
	add "set all oscs" action

PENDING

TODO

setting meta parameters doesn't set their discrete param controls SIGH
bank window cells are sized according to names! wtf? they should be static
revisit parameter change scenarios
	revisit how PatchWindow.setParameterValue() works
write joystick test app to check we have it right
