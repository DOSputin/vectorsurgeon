Description:
	By "altemark" : The Future Retro 777 is an analog bassline machine with a nice integrated sequencer. A nice 3 pole lowpass filter, switchable to 8 pole is backed up by a non-resonant highpass filter in the end of the audio chain. 

A large palette of sounds is possible thanks to the simple but useful routing possibilities with two oscillators, two suboscillators, a noise oscillator, both frequency and filter modulation and so on. 

This pack features single cycle waveforms, both raw oscillators, different cutoff and resonance settings as well more complex modulated sounds.
